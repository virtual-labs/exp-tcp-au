### Procedure

1. Student has to enter a random four digit number which indicates the beginning of the sequence numbers(SYN) for data to be transmitted by Client A. 

2. Click “Begin” to start the simulation.

3. Observe the packet being sent from client to server.
4. Enter a random four digit number which indicates server random sequence number and click continue.
5. Observe the response from the server which includes the SYN packet from the server and the acknowledgment number (ACK)
	- ACK is nothing but the Client A’s  sequence number incremented by one.
    
6. Enter a random string that acts as a message to be sent by Client A to the server and click continue.
